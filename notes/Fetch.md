# Fetch API
Fetch API is a browser Web API. It is not part of JS native langauge.

- Axios is good as well but don't download another dependency if you aren't using its core features. Fetch is perfectly fine if you are doing simple API calls. [Use Axios if you do something likee intercepts](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/1hp5glg/should_i_use_fetch_or_axios_to_make_api_calls/)
